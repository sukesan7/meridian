**Meridian** is a deterministic, event-driven backtesting engine created for the high-fidelity simulation of intraday futures strategies. It prioritizes correctness, causal integrity, and reproducibility over raw execution speed, serving as a rapid prototyping environment for **Strategy 3A** (VWAP Trend Pullback) logic.

The system is currently deployed to validate a singular strategy (**Strategy 3A**) on **Nasdaq-100 (NQ)** futures data, enforcing strict session boundaries and regime-adaptive execution models.

## 1. Core Philosophy & Architecture

Meridian addresses the "Backtest-Reality Gap" prevalent in quantitative research by enforcing a strict **Data Contract** and **State Machine** execution model.

### Key Engineering Principles
* **Semantic Determinism:** Identical inputs (Data, Config, Seed) guarantee identical PnL and trade artifacts. This is enforced via a **Regression Gate** in CI, which verifies strict output stability and reproducibility across simulation runs.
* **Causal Integrity & Latency Simulation:** The engine adheres to strict causality in both signal generation and execution. It enforces `n-bar` delays on indicators and simulates execution latency by filling orders at the Next Bar Open, eliminating the "optimistic fill" bias common in close-on-close backtesters.
* **Session-Aware Execution:** Native handling of exchange timezones (`America/New_York`) and RTH (09:30–16:00 ET) boundaries prevents signal leakage across trading sessions.
* **Regime-Adaptive Friction:** Slippage models are time-variant, applying higher friction during high-volatility windows (e.g., the "Hot Window" during the 09:30 Opening Range).

### Data Flow Pipeline
The engine operates as a unidirectional pipeline, transforming raw vendor data into auditable trade artifacts.

```

## 2. Strategy Logic (Strategy 3A)

The engine implements a multi-stage finite state machine (FSM) to identify high-probability setups. Unlike simple vector crossovers, **Strategy 3A** requires a specific sequence of market states:

1.  **Unlock Phase:** The system monitors for a volatility expansion (Opening Range Breakout) aligned with the 5-minute trend structure.
2.  **Zone Phase:** Once unlocked, the engine waits for a mean-reversion pullback into the value area (VWAP +- 1$\sigma$).
3.  **Trigger Phase:** Trades are executed only upon confirmation of a micro-structure breakout (Confirmed Swing High/Low) within the value zone.

### Logic Visualization (v1.0.3)
*Trace of the State Machine during a typical session. Note the strict delay in Swing High (Red Triangle) confirmation, proving causal integrity.*

## 3. Performance (v1.0.3 Release)

*Audited results derived from a 12-month Out-of-Sample (OOS) period on NQ (2024-2025). The metrics below reflect the strict enforcement of causal execution protocols, volatility gating, and accurate slippage modeling.*

| Metric           | Value       | Description                                                    |
| :--------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Return** | **+5.86 R** | Risk-adjusted return over the simulation period.               |
| **Max Drawdown** | **-5.77 R** | Maximum Peak-to-Valley decline (Summer 2024 Volatility Crush). |
| **Win Rate**     | **49.3%**   | Classic Trend-Following profile (Avg Win > Avg Loss).          |
| **Trade Count**  | **67**      | High-selectivity execution (approx. 5.5 trades/month).         |

### Performance Verification
*Equity progression and drawdown analysis generated by Meridian v1.0.3.*

The simulation below demonstrates the engine's ability to capture regime-dependent performance. Note the flat/drawdown period during the mid-year volatility crush, followed by recovery as trends re-emerged in Q4. This validates the effectiveness of the `filters.py` regime detection logic.

## 4. Data Verification

To ensure simulation fidelity, the input data (Nasdaq-100 1-Minute Bars) undergoes rigorous integrity checks prior to backtesting.

### A. Session Density
*Validation of bar counts per RTH session. The target is 390 bars (09:30–15:59 ET). Consistent density confirms no missing data gaps during trading hours.*

### B. Volatility Regime Analysis
*Distribution of 1-Minute True Range (volatility). The heavy right tail indicates periods of extreme expansion (News/Breakouts), which the `filters.py` module uses to gate trade entries.*

## 6. Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Dependencies managed via `pyproject.toml` (Pandas, NumPy, PyArrow, SciPy, PyYAML)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install in editable mode. The build system will automatically resolve the best compatible versions for your OS (Linux/Windows/Mac).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/sukesan7/meridian.git](https://github.com/sukesan7/meridian.git)
cd meridian

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install package + dev tools (Ruff, Mypy, Pytest)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running a Demo (No Data Required)
If you do not possess proprietary NQ futures data, you can verify the engine's logic by running the test suite. The tests generate **synthetic market data** on the fly to validate the execution engine, slippage models, and state machine.

```bash
# Run full test suite with verbose output
pytest -v
```

---

## 7. Usage & Workflows

Meridian utilizes a unified CLI `meridian-run` for all simulation modes.

### A. Standard Backtest (In-Sample)
Executes the strategy over a fixed period and generates `trades.parquet` and `signals.parquet`.

```bash
meridian-run backtest \
  --config configs/base.yaml \
  --data data/vendor_parquet/NQ/NQ_2024_RTH.parquet \
  --run-id v1_0_2_baseline
```

### B. Walk-Forward Analysis (Robustness)
Performs rolling-window validation to detect overfitting. Default: 63-day Train / 21-day Test.

```bash
meridian-run walkforward \
  --config configs/base.yaml \
  --data data/vendor_parquet/NQ/NQ_2024_RTH.parquet \
  --is-days 63 --oos-days 21 \
  --run-id v1_0_2_wfo
```

### C. Monte Carlo (Risk Assessment)
Applies block-bootstrap resampling to the trade distribution to estimate tail risks and drawdown probabilities.

```bash
meridian-run monte-carlo \
  --config configs/base.yaml \
  --trades outputs/backtest/v1_0_2_baseline/trades.parquet \
  --n-paths 2500 \
  --seed 7
```

## 8. Engineering Standards & Quality Gates

This project enforces strict software engineering standards suitable for production environments.

* **Static Typing:** Fully typed codebase verified by `mypy` in CI. Enforces type safety to catch interface errors across the core engine and signal generation logic.
* **Linting & Formatting:** Enforced via `ruff` (replaces Flake8/Black/Isort) for consistent style.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automatically runs the test suite and type checkers on every push/PR.
* **Reproducible Environments:** Strict dependency versioning is enforced via `requirements.lock`, ensuring identical execution environments on both Windows dev machines and Linux CI runners.
* **Determinism Gate:** Automated verification scripts ensure `Run A` and `Run B` produce semantically identical outputs, protecting against logic drift.

To run the quality suite locally:
```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Run static analysis
mypy s3a_backtester
```

## 9. Data Contract

Meridian requires 1-minute OHLCV data normalized to the `vendor_parquet` schema.

**Expected Columns:**
* `timestamp` (DatetimeTZ, UTC)
* `open`, `high`, `low`, `close` (Float64)
* `volume` (Float64/Int64)

**Pipeline Note:**
The engine internally converts UTC timestamps to `America/New_York` to align with US Equity Futures session timings (RTH 09:30 - 16:00 ET).

---

## 10. Future Roadmap

* **Performance:** Migration of the core `engine.py` loop from Pandas/NumPy to **Polars** (Rust) for improved vectorization throughput and zero-copy memory management.
* **Statistical Rigor:** Implementation of **Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)** and **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)** to explicitly quantify and penalize multiple testing bias in strategy selection.
* **Market Microstructure:** Upgrade of execution models to include **Vectorized Market Impact** (e.g., Square Root Law) for liquidity-dependent slippage, alongside L2 order book pressure integration.
* **Generative Risk:** Integration of **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to generate synthetic market regimes for robust Monte Carlo stress testing beyond historical bootstrapping.
* **Multi-Asset Support:** Architecture extensions to support execution logic on Equities, ETFs, and other futures contracts.
* **Strategy Expansion:** Implementation and validation of complementary strategies (**Strategy 1A**, **2A**, **4A**) to diversify the portfolio.
