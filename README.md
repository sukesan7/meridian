**Meridian** is a deterministic, event-driven backtesting engine created for the high-fidelity simulation of intraday futures strategies. It prioritizes correctness, causal integrity, and reproducibility over raw execution speed, serving as a rapid prototyping environment for **Strategy 3A** (VWAP Trend Pullback) logic.

The system is currently deployed to validate a singular strategy (**Strategy 3A**) on **Nasdaq-100 (NQ)** futures data, enforcing strict session boundaries and regime-adaptive execution models.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy & Architecture

Meridian addresses the "Backtest-Reality Gap" prevalent in quantitative research by enforcing a strict **Data Contract** and **State Machine** execution model.

### Key Engineering Principles
* **Semantic Determinism:** Identical inputs (Data, Config, Seed) guarantee identical PnL and trade artifacts. This is enforced via a **Regression Gate** in CI, which verifies strict output stability and reproducibility across simulation runs.
* **Causal Integrity & Latency Simulation:** The engine adheres to strict causality in both signal generation and execution. It enforces `n-bar` delays on indicators and simulates execution latency by filling orders at the Next Bar Open, eliminating the "optimistic fill" bias common in close-on-close backtesters.
* **Session-Aware Execution:** Native handling of exchange timezones (`America/New_York`) and RTH (09:30–16:00 ET) boundaries prevents signal leakage across trading sessions.
* **Regime-Adaptive Friction:** Slippage models are time-variant, applying higher friction during high-volatility windows (e.g., the "Hot Window" during the 09:30 Opening Range).

### Data Flow Pipeline
The engine operates as a unidirectional pipeline, transforming raw vendor data into auditable trade artifacts.

```

## 2. Strategy Logic (Strategy 3A)

The engine implements a multi-stage finite state machine (FSM) to identify high-probability setups. Unlike simple vector crossovers, **Strategy 3A** requires a specific sequence of market states:

1.  **Unlock Phase:** The system monitors for a volatility expansion (Opening Range Breakout) aligned with the 5-minute trend structure.
2.  **Zone Phase:** Once unlocked, the engine waits for a mean-reversion pullback into the value area (VWAP +- 1$\sigma$).
3.  **Trigger Phase:** Trades are executed only upon confirmation of a micro-structure breakout (Confirmed Swing High/Low) within the value zone.

### Logic Visualization (v1.0.5)
*Trace of the State Machine during a typical session. Note the strict delay in Swing High (Red Triangle) confirmation, proving causal integrity.*

## 3. Performance (v1.0.5 Release)

*Audited results derived from a 12-month evaluation period on NQ (2024-2025). The metrics below reflect the strict enforcement of causal execution protocols, volatility gating, and accurate slippage modeling.*

### Overall Performance
| Metric | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Win Rate** | `50.7%` | Robust trend-following profile. |
| **Profit Factor** | `1.23` | Gross Win / Gross Loss. |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | `1.51` | Risk-adjusted return (Est. Annualized). |
| **Max Drawdown** | `-4.89 R` | Duration: 192 Days (Honest reporting of regime shifts). |
| **Runtime** | `13.3s` | Full 1-year event loop (Core i9 Reference). |

### Latency & Profiling
| Component | Duration | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Backtest** | `13.30s` | End-to-End (Feature Gen + Event Loop) |
| **Walk-Forward** | `15.66s` | 63/21 IS/OOS |
| **Monte Carlo** | `0.49s` | 2,500 Iteration Block Bootstrap |

### Performance Verification
*Analytics generated by Meridian v1.0.5.*

The simulation below demonstrates the engine's ability to capture and visualize regime-dependent performance with granular transparency.
* **Regime Sensitivity:** The **Rolling Win Rate** panel tracks consistency shifts, clearly identifying the mid-year volatility crush where trend capture became statistically difficult.
* **Risk Architecture:** The **Drawdown Profile** (Red) visualizes the exact duration and depth of "underwater" periods, verifying that stop-loss protocols remain robust even during extended drawdowns.
* **Statistical Edge:** The **Outcome Distribution** histogram proves the strategy's asymmetry—rigidly cutting losses at -1R while allowing fat-tail winners to expand, validating the core Event-Driven execution logic.

## 4. Data Verification

To ensure simulation fidelity, the input data (Nasdaq-100 1-Minute Bars) undergoes rigorous integrity checks prior to backtesting.

### A. Session Density
*Validation of bar counts per RTH session. The target is 390 bars (09:30–15:59 ET). Consistent density confirms no missing data gaps during trading hours.*

![Session Density](assets/nq_session_density.png)

### B. Volatility Regime Analysis
*Distribution of 1-Minute True Range (volatility). The heavy right tail indicates periods of extreme expansion (News/Breakouts), which the `filters.py` module uses to gate trade entries.*

### Artifact Integrity
Every run produces an immutable **Audit Trail**:
* `run_meta.json`: Full config snapshot + Random Seed.
* `trades.parquet`: Row-level execution log with `signal_time` vs `entry_time`.
* `summary.json`: Hashable performance metrics.

## 8. Engineering Standards & Quality Gates

This project enforces strict software engineering standards suitable for production environments.

* **Static Typing:** Fully typed codebase verified by `mypy` in CI. Enforces type safety to catch interface errors across the core engine and signal generation logic.
* **Linting & Formatting:** Enforced via `ruff` (replaces Flake8/Black/Isort) for consistent style.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automatically runs the test suite and type checkers on every push/PR.
* **Reproducible Environments:** Strict dependency versioning is enforced via `requirements.lock`, ensuring identical execution environments on both Windows dev machines and Linux CI runners.
* **Determinism Gate:** Automated verification scripts ensure `Run A` and `Run B` produce semantically identical outputs, protecting against logic drift.

To run the quality suite locally:
```bash
# Format code
ruff format .

# Run static analysis
mypy s3a_backtester
```

### CI/CD Enforcement
Every PR triggers `verify_determinism.py`, where CI verifies semantic determinism by comparing normalized trade logs and summary outputs.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Verify Semantic Determinism
  run: |
    python scripts/debug_tools/verify_determinism.py \
      ci_artifacts/run_A/trades.parquet \
      ci_artifacts/run_B/trades.parquet
```

## 9. Data Contract

Meridian requires 1-minute OHLCV data normalized to the `vendor_parquet` schema.

**Expected Columns:**
* `timestamp` (DatetimeTZ, UTC)
* `open`, `high`, `low`, `close` (Float64)
* `volume` (Float64/Int64)

**Pipeline Note:**
The engine internally converts UTC timestamps to `America/New_York` to align with US Equity Futures session timings (RTH 09:30 - 16:00 ET).

---

## 10. Future Roadmap

* **Performance:** Migration of the core `engine.py` loop from Pandas/NumPy to **Polars** (Rust) for improved vectorization throughput and zero-copy memory management.
* **Statistical Rigor:** Implementation of **Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation (CPCV)** and **Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR)** to explicitly quantify and penalize multiple testing bias in strategy selection.
* **Market Microstructure:** Upgrade of execution models to include **Vectorized Market Impact** (e.g., Square Root Law) for liquidity-dependent slippage, alongside L2 order book pressure integration.
* **Generative Risk:** Integration of **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** to generate synthetic market regimes for robust Monte Carlo stress testing beyond historical bootstrapping.
* **Multi-Asset Support:** Architecture extensions to support execution logic on Equities, ETFs, and other futures contracts.
* **Strategy Expansion:** Implementation and validation of complementary strategies (**Strategy 1A**, **2A**, **4A**) to diversify the portfolio.
